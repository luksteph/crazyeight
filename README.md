Play CrazyEight in the command line!

Reuses code from a school project that I should not name here so I don't violate the Honor Code. Some of this
code, specifically the nebulous structure, comes from the school's starter files. That means I did not write it.
Credit is given in the appropriate files.

Written as a stripped-down version of GamePigeon's Crazy8s game, but with the option to have simple "AI" players
(made with love and lots of if-else statements). I did this because my cousins couldn't make it to our holiday
gathering to play with me since one of them is sick.
